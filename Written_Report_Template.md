# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Louis was planning to do a crowdfunding campaign for her play Fever. It's her first time doing a project campaign so she turned to me. We were going to help her by using Excel to organize, sort and analyze all the project campaigns to determine if there were any specific factors that make a campaign successful. We would use this to help Louis to create a successful project campaign plan.
