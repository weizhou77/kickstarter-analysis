# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
Louis was planning to do a crowdfunding campaign for her play Fever. It's her first time doing a project campaign so she turned to me. We were going to help her by using Excel to organize, sort and analyze all the project campaigns to determine if there were any specific factors that make a campaign successful. We would use this to help Louis to create a successful project campaign plan.
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
We use pivot table and graphing to visusalize the campaign outcomes based on launch date for Theator Category. On the visual graph, the Y axis represents the counts and x axis represents the campaign launch months; there are three lines and each represents "successful", "failed" and "canceled" outcomes. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
We use visual graph to show the percentage of successful, failed and canceled outcomes for the subcategory "play" based on the funding goal amount. On the graph, the y-axis represents the percentage number and x-axis represents the goal amount; there are three lines on the graph and ecach represents the "successful", "failed" and "canceled" outcome.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
A possible challenge will be putting wrong elements or field name into wrong box on the pivot table fields. A possible solution for the challenge will be creating a graph for the table to check if the graph is readable and reasonable.
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

For the theater category, one conclusion would be that the month of May, June and July have the most theater category campaigns and these three months have the highest successful percentage which are 66.87%,65.36% and 62.04%. The reason for this could be that it's summer break time. Another conclusion would be December has the least theater campaigns and lowest successful percentage which is 49.33%.


- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

A conclusion for the Outcomes based on Goals would be if the goal amount is over $45000, the campaign outcomes are mostlikely failed. Louis's goal is $10000, so her successful percentage would be 54.17%.


- What are some limitations of this dataset?




- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Since we are doing charts about percentages, we can use a pie chart to show the outcomes for the "play" subcategory based on goal amounts.
